        <p>I have played more with elisp just a little bit and found it quite a simple language to work with. </p>
<h2 id="What_to_look_for">What to look for</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html" target="_blank" rel="external">GNU Elisp documentation</a> is simply awesome. It contains a lot of examples and information.</p>
<p>IRC #emacs channel on freenode is another source of help. People there are quick to respond and often answer within minutes.</p>
<p>Also <code>paredit</code> mode helps with parentheses as if it automatically writes matching <code>)</code> when you write <code>(</code> like I write <code>(defun</code> and it immediately adds <code>)</code> at the end. Also it doesnt let you automatically remove either of parenthesis if there’s some content in between. In that case it moves cursor to the beginning of a word for you to delete first and then with one remove key deletes both parens.</p>
<h2 id="Variable_logger">Variable logger</h2>
<p>When I use Lua I often call my middleware logging library to log out variables. I have made a similar thing but in the language itself in <a href="https://github.com/LukasPukenis/prettyDebug" target="_blank" rel="external">Javascript</a> but it has limitations and is only for debugging purposes so making an editor spew out the needed log call is the way here.</p>
<p>The function is one of my first more real attempts to make somthing with elisp. I don’t care about optimizing it or so as I will call it once in a while only.</p>

<p>My function for logging is <code>log:warn(x, y, z, ...)</code> and I wanted to write <code>x y z</code> mark it and run command to generate the needed call.</p>
<p>So it begs for an explanation as in the other case there’s no point of writing about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>defun name args</code> defines a function with a name and list of arguments</li>
<li><code>interactive &quot;r&quot;</code> means our function can be found with <code>M-x</code> and argument <code>r</code> means that it receives two<br>parameters - start and end points of our selected region</li>
<li><code>let</code>, <code>setq</code>, <code>buffer-substring-no-properties</code>, <code>message</code> were explained in <a href="http://www.letsdive.in/2014/11/15/Emacs---The-returning/" target="_blank" rel="external">previous</a> post</li>
<li><code>mapcar</code> applies a function to each element of a list</li>
<li><code>reverse</code> returns reversed list</li>
<li><code>split-string</code> splits passed string by passed separators. As we have not passed any it simply splits by whitespace</li>
<li><code>mapconcat</code> the same as <code>mapcar</code> but concatenates the results into a string starting string with the last parameter</li>
<li><code>identity</code> function which returns the same elements. It’s useful as <code>mapconcat</code> runs a function to retrieve elements and as our elements will be strings, there are no modifications, so <code>identity</code> just returns them. It’s just a filler as function requires a function to return elements.</li>
<li><code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code> and <code>last</code> are list processing functions. <code>car</code> - returns first element, <code>cdr</code> - everything except first. <code>last</code> speaks for itself.</li>
<li><code>concat</code> concatenates passed strings into one string</li>
<li><code>substring</code> returns portion of passed string from start to end indexes. If end index is negative it removes towards the end so in our case <code>0 -2</code> removes the <code>,</code> we have just added previously when <code>mapcar</code>ed the list to have “item”=item, …</li>
<li><code>delete-region</code> deletes region. With this call we remove our selected region</li>
<li><code>insert</code> this insert content into a buffer at cursor location. In combination with <code>delete-region</code> it removes our selection and replaces with a new one</li>
</ul>
<p>In a few words our function:</p>
<ul>
<li>extracts our selection</li>
<li>builds a list <code>variables</code> with each item in a string transformed into <code>&quot;item=&quot;, item,</code></li>
<li>grabs all the elements from <code>variables</code> except for last and concats them into one string</li>
<li>appends the last element with the last <code>,</code> removed</li>
<li>replaces selected region with a new string</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning I noted this is unoptimized - when we grab every item except last I don’t know the existing function so I just reverse the list, so the last item is now the first then run <code>cdr</code> to grab everything except it and reverse back.</p>
<p>Now as I evaluate this function I may want to log out my <code>event</code> object along with mouse coordinates so I just type:</p>
<p><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">event</span> mouseX mouseY_
</pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>and my cursor is at <code>_</code> then I <code>C-SPC C-a</code> to mark the whole line then <code>M-x lua-log</code> and voila. Now of course this method can be bind to some key combination but I believe I shouldn’t waste key bindings for such a seldom task so <code>M-x pattern</code> way works especially when you can type in a pattern like <code>lulo</code> and if it doesnt collide with another similar named function it will be selected.</p>

        <p>So I have started trying to use Emacs again after like half a year after my first try. And this time it’s a pleasure. I believe I needed more different approach.</p>
<p>Note that for each plugin you should read it’s documentation about how to set up it properly for your needs. It will probably cost you a few hours to set things up properly but I amortized the cost between different days, adding more stuff each day and also getting used to the stuff I have already added.</p>
<h3 id="What_have_I_done_differently">What have I done differently</h3>
<p>What I have installed immediately by searching over the internet to supply me with similar to sublime features</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch control key to caps lock key</li>
<li>Melpa package repository</li>
<li>Helm</li>
<li>Projectile</li>
<li>Helm-projectile</li>
</ul>
<p>And my emacs life was never the same. With only these few modules Emacs immediately became almost as efficient as Sublime text for me.</p>
<h2 id="Keys">Keys</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>C-x</code> is hold control and then press <code>x</code>.</li>
<li><code>C-x C-x</code> means hold control and press <code>x</code>, release control and repeat. Or you can hold control and hit <code>x</code> twice!</li>
<li><code>C-x s</code> means hold control, then hit <code>x</code>, release control and hit <code>s</code></li>
<li><code>M-x</code> means <code>alt</code>  key and then <code>x</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Caps_lock">Caps lock</h2>
<p>I have read about switching control key to caps lock on a lot of websites and decided to give it a try. It really helps to use Emacs as my pinky sits on caps lock naturally. And I don’t feel awkward.</p>
<h2 id="Melpa">Melpa</h2>
<p>Melpa is a repository for Emacs packages. It contains a big list of packages and needs a mention here.<br>Add this to your <code>.emacs</code> and never turn back:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="list">(<span class="title">when</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;=</span> emacs-major-version <span class="number">24</span>)</span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">require</span> 'package)</span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">package-initialize</span>)</span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">add-to-list</span> 'package-archives <span class="quoted">'(<span class="string">"melpa"</span> . <span class="string">"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"</span>)</span> <span class="literal">t</span>)</span>
  )</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can view packages with <code>M-x list-packages</code> or install immediately with <code>M-x install-package</code>. Package manager lets me to try a lot of different plugins immediately and grep through some keywords I am interested in. For example I am interested if something comes with <code>*undo*</code>in package name, so I <code>M-x list-packages</code> then <code>C-s</code> and search for my query.</p>
<h2 id="Undo/redo_copy/paste_and_cancel_things">Undo/redo copy/paste and cancel things</h2>
<p>One major thing which I was missing was <code>C-z</code> and <code>C-y</code> for undo/redo. These standart keybindings are available in <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/CuaMode" target="_blank" rel="external">CuaMode</a>  but I was headed for a challenge. Also Cua mode lets you have standart copy/cut keywords as standart Emacs copy is <code>M-w</code> and cut is <code>C-w</code> and paste is <code>C-y</code>.</p>
<p>Emacs has your back with  <code>C-x u</code> to undo. Emacs undo/redo tree is kind of different from usual applications and needs time to get used to but the good thing is - you can almost always revert to a previous state.</p>
<p><code>C-g</code> cancels current command. In case you messed up some Emacs chord or launched not wanted command <code>C-g</code> and it’s canceled.</p>
<p>If some annoying buffer opened and you want to get rid of it hit <code>C-x k</code> to kill it or <code>C-x &lt;left&gt;</code> or <code>C-x &lt;right</code>&gt; to switch to previous or next buffer. <code>C-x b</code> opens you a list of buffers you have and you can enter a pattern.</p>
<p>To redo simply cancel redo. How so? Example:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>i <span class="keyword">say</span>
hello
emacs
<span class="number">_</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>My cursors is <code>_</code>. Now <code>C-x u</code> moves cursor one line up to the end of the line, another <code>C-x u</code> removes <code>emacs</code> line and so forth. Now what if I want to redo? Then <code>C-g</code> and each <code>C-x u</code> will now redo. To master this in Emacs I highly recommend reading a manual as it’s quite hard to understand without some experimentation and a manual.</p>
<h2 id="Helm_?">Helm ?</h2>
<p>Helm changes Emacs popups with more appealing and interactive ones of Helm. I do not underestimate Emacs but Helm really improves experience. Upon quick configuration by guide I can:</p>
<h3 id="See_interactive_window_as_I_type_M-x">See interactive window as I type M-x</h3>
<p>This lets me type in a pattern for a command I am looking for. Need I sort lines but don’t remember the command? “M-x sor li” and in the results I immediately see possible candidates:</p>
<img src="/images/emacs/4/meta%20x.jpg" class="[]">

<h3 id="Interactive_occurrence_of_a_pattern">Interactive occurrence of a pattern</h3>
<p><code>helm-occur</code> differs from Emacs native <code>occur</code> command so that it’s interactive meaning when I navigate with keys through results helm automatically focus Emacs to show the cursor on appropriate line instead of switching to results frame and hitting RET on wanted occurrence.</p>
<h2 id="Projectile">Projectile</h2>
<p>This is simply a must plugin for working on a project. You can set the project by putting a <code>.projectile</code> into your project. In the file you can also add files or directories to ignore for projectile.</p>
<p>Projectile works with helm and there are only two functions I use. Bind them to any key you want:</p>
<p>1) <code>helm-projectile</code> if not in a project it asks you to open a project and shows the recent one. If the project is opened it lets you enter a pattern and interactively shows you matched files in your directory! (Sublime text users <code>C-p</code>)</p>
<p>2) <code>projectile-grep</code> greps through the project for a pattern. I set it to <code>C-c g</code>. If I want to search in certain files I do <code>C-u C-c g</code> and then after typing in a pattern I can type in a pattern for files like <code>*.lua</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Marks">Marks</h2>
<p>When interacting with a buffer it’s really often needed to bookmark certain parts to jump quickly later. For this functionality Emacs has mark ring.<br><code>C-x C-x</code> to set mark<br><code>C-u C-x</code> to iterate through mark ring.<br>It’s a simple killer feature which can be learned to be used in under a minute.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a big file and you just hit some interesting place and you quickly need to jump to the head of the file and jump back. You do <code>C-x C-x</code> then <code>M-&lt;</code> after you look for your file header <code>C-u C-x</code> and you are where you have just been.</p>
<h2 id="Rectangles">Rectangles</h2>
<p>Rectangles allow to work with rectangular areas of the buffer. This at first seemed like a useless feature. Who works on rectangles..? It seems I work on rectangles. A LOT. You can add test, replace text, delete rectangular area and so on.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">demo</span>()</span>
<span class="built_in">local</span> <span class="operator">a</span> = <span class="number">1</span>
<span class="built_in">local</span> b = <span class="number">2</span>
<span class="built_in">local</span> c = <span class="number">3</span>
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">end</span></span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I want to indent those local variable declarations using rectangles. Put the cursor on <code>l</code> on first <code>local</code>. Then <code>C-space</code> to start selecting, hit down two times so it looks like this:</p>
<img src="/images/emacs/4/selection.JPG" class="[]">

<p>and now <code>C-x r t</code> to replace rectangular area with text. It will prompt you for a replacement. Our rectangle is area between selection start and end. Type in <code> </code> two empty spaces and RET. Bam:</p>
<img src="/images/emacs/4/indented.jpg" class="[]">

<p>Now I want to remove those <code>local</code> strings. I put my cursor on first <code>l</code> letter of first <code>local</code> definition. Hit down arrow twice and <code>M-f</code> to move cursor one word forward. I got this:</p>
<img src="/images/emacs/4/removed.JPG" class="[]">

<p>Now <code>C-x r d</code> to remove rectangular area and those <code>local</code> definitions are long gone.</p>
<p><code>C-x r c</code> lets you fill in a rectangle with spaces. Not delete like <code>C-x r d</code> but replace with space symbols.</p>
<p>Another neat feature I just found is <code>C-x r N</code> which puts numbers increasing from 1 to each rectangular area start position. In our demo case if we again select first <code>l</code> letters of three <code>local</code> definitions and hit <code>C-x r N</code> we see this:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">demo</span>()</span>
  <span class="number">1</span> <span class="built_in">local</span> <span class="operator">a</span> = <span class="number">1</span>
  <span class="number">2</span> <span class="built_in">local</span> b = <span class="number">2</span>
  <span class="number">3</span> <span class="built_in">local</span> c = <span class="number">3</span>
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">end</span></span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I like this feature as it shows me how dynamic Emacs is not that I use it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Multiple_cursors">Multiple cursors</h2>
<p>It’s <a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el" target="_blank" rel="external">mc</a> library. It provides plenty of functions and I use only three with custom key bindings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-&gt;</code> <code>mc/mark-next-like-this</code> adds the cursor on the next occurrence of<br>current selecion</li>
<li><code>C-&lt;</code> <code>mc/mark-previous-like-this</code>adds the cursor on the previous occurrence of current selection</li>
<li><code>C-c C-&lt;</code> <code>mc/mark-all-like-this</code> adds cursors on all the occurences in a buffer</li>
</ul>
<p>Example time:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">capitalizeName</span><span class="params">(name)</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">return</span> name.uppercase
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Put the cursor on <code>n</code> of <code>name</code> in arguments then <code>C-space M-f</code> to select the whole word and <code>C-&gt;</code> and watch as both <code>name</code> occurences are selected. If you type in anything it replaces both words with a new input. However sometimes I don’t want to rewrite whole occurrences so <code>C-g</code> cancel selections and leaves only cursors set. Hit <code>C-g</code> again to cancel additional cursors and leave original one.</p>
<h2 id="Screen_layouts">Screen layouts</h2>
<p>I always used to split screen at least vertically to have 2 windows when coding. So I searched for the same functionality in Emacs and it’s of course - a built-in feature. To cut a long story short these are the default key-bindings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-x 1</code> make current buffer the only one visible and stretch to fill the whole window</li>
<li><code>C-x 2</code> split frame horizontally</li>
<li><code>C-x 3</code> split frame vertically</li>
<li><code>C-x 0</code> kill current frame</li>
</ul>
<p>To switch between windows <code>C-x o</code>. It’s a sad thing it switches in order and you don’t have a way to define which exactly window with an arrow key or so. The commands split the current frame, so in case you split once vertically and again vertically You have <code>|AB|C|</code> layout. To auto resize all the frames <code>C-x +</code>.</p>
<p>Better news - <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove" target="_blank" rel="external">windmove</a>. I have only this line in my <code>.emacs</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="list">(<span class="title">windmove-default-keybindings</span> 'meta)</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And what it allows me to do is <code>M-arrow</code> to switch between window frames. The good part it is quite self aware and intuitive so a must have plugin.</p>
<p>Killer feature about frames I found is registers. <code>C-x r w _</code> means write window configuration to register where <code>_</code> is a character corresponding a register for example <code>a</code>.  Loading data from register or jumping is <code>C-x j _</code> where <code>_</code> is the name. </p>
<p>Imagine a situation - you have window split into 4 parts opened different files and doing some work. For a minute you want to stare at one file in fullscreen. So <code>C-x o</code> until you hit the needed buffer <code>C-x 1</code> to make it fullscreen and now you need again to split windows, jump to buffers, etc. Don’t worry! Once you want to get rid of the layout temporarily hit <code>C-x r w a</code>  then navigate to buffer you want <code>C-x 1</code>. Once you have finished and want that layout back <code>C-x r j a</code> and they are back. This is such a good feature that Emacs immediately became instantly a lot better.</p>
<h2 id="Themes">Themes</h2>
<p>There are so many <a href="http://emacsthemes.caisah.info/" target="_blank" rel="external">emacs themes</a>. Also available in package list. You can choose any you want and modify each of them as you want. There’s only one negative thing I noticed about most of the themes - they cause my Emacs to crash and I am sure it’s because of themes. Despite that fact some themes are very awesome and you can easily switch between them with <code>M-x load-theme</code>.</p>
<h2 id="More_cool_features_I_have_found">More cool features I have found</h2>
<p>Neat features I have found while randomly wandering around the internet.</p>
<h3 id="undo-tree">undo-tree</h3>
<p>A cool plugin/mode you need to enable to get usage of. It shows Emacs undo-redo ring in a tree way which looks kinda cool but I am not used to it yet. Look at it:</p>
<img src="/images/emacs/4/undo%20tree.jpg" class="[]">

<p>Where <code>x</code> is the current position in a tree. You can choose the branches and if you choose a branch and do more changes it makes another branch so basically you can visually navigate through the tree with arrow keys and immediately see the changes in your active buffer.</p>
<h3 id="Abbreviations">Abbreviations</h3>
<p>This is what I fell immediately in love with. Abbreviations are like your own corrections which Emacs handles for me. I often type in “log:warn()” in our codebase to log the data in Lua but I often mistype “log” with “lgo” out of rush.</p>
<p>There are two places where one can put in abbreviations. Those two places are: global scope and mode scope. For example I don’t want my “lgo-&gt;log” abbreviation to work everywhere. I want that only in lua major mode. That’s what <code>add-mode-abbrev</code> is for and <code>add-global-abbrev</code> is for global scope.</p>
<p>Note! Abbreviations only work when <code>abbrev-mode</code> is enabled so be sure to <code>M-x abbrev-mode</code>. Keys for abbreviations:</p>
<p><code>C-x a +</code> add-mode-abbrev<br><code>C-x a g</code> add-global-abbrev</p>
<p>Example time!<br>Type in <code>logX</code> where X is the cursor. <code>C-x a g</code> and in the prompt type in <code>lgo</code>. From now on once <code>lgo</code> is typed and a space, return, tab, or any other non character input comes Emacs changes <code>lgo</code> into <code>log</code>. Neat!</p>
<h3 id="Forgot_what_are_the_key_bindings_for_a_function?">Forgot what are the key bindings for a function?</h3>
<p><code>M-x describe-function</code> prompts you for a function name and in the new buffer shows you attached key binding if one exists.</p>
<h3 id="Want_to_know_information_about_some_variable?">Want to know information about some variable?</h3>
<p>For example I ran Emacs on Windows and didn’t know where my .emacs file is stored.<br><code>M-x describe-variable</code> and type in <code>user-init-file</code>. Bam:</p>
<hr>
<p>user-init-file is a variable defined in `C source code’.<br>Its value is “c:/Users/Lukas/AppData/Roaming/.emacs”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now I want to open that file without touching my mouse because Emacs?</p>
<p>I can <code>C-x C-f</code> or simply hold <code>C</code> then press <code>x</code> and <code>f</code> and I can type in the path to that file.</p>
<p>I am really fancy so I will switch to that window with <code>C-x o</code> then <code>M-&lt;</code> to go to the beginning of the freshly opened buffer, put my cursor on the second line, then <code>C-3 M-f</code> to move my cursor 3 words forward, <code>C-space C-e</code> to start selecting and go to the end of the line and <code>M-w</code> to copy that file name. Now <code>C-x C-f</code> and I have file access prompt ready but it’s filled with my current path? <code>C-a C-k C-y</code> to go to the beginning of the line and kill the whole line forward and <code>C-y</code> to “yank” or paste our selection. Now the problem is that we have pasted with quotes around the text. So <code>C-a del</code> and <code>C-e backspace</code> to remove those. RET. Wow my .emacs file is opened.</p>
<p>Man that was a chore. I bet any 5th grader with a mouse would do that faster. If you hate the manual stuff as much as I do read forward. We will simply define an Emacs command or record a macro(later post on those). Emacs uses elisp but for combining several commands it’s pretty easy to learn.</p>
<p>Like how hard it is to write simple elisp code? In this case I want a function to copy contents between two double quotes on the current line my cursors is. Look:</p>

<p>Now If I again <code>describe-user-variable</code> and enter <code>user-init-file</code> move my cursor on that line, call this function and path is copied into my kill-ring. With a simple <code>(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c q c&quot;) &#39;copy-in-quotes)</code> I can bind this function to <code>C-c q c</code> key binding. Note that when binding your own key bindings use <code>C-c</code> not <code>C-x</code> as <code>C-x</code> is default Emacs key binding so you may overwrite some good stuff.</p>
<p>Let me run through a brief explanation of what we did here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(interactive)</code> means our function can be called via <code>M-x name</code>. Simple as that.</li>
<li><code>(message variable)</code> outputs the variable value in minibuffer area as I want to display what we have copied.</li>
<li><code>(kill-new line)</code> actually doesn’t kill anything. This function simply puts the value in a kill-ring*.</li>
<li><code>let</code> allows me to have some variables defined and used in scope. Form is <code>(let (a b c) (use-a-b-c))</code>.</li>
<li><code>setq</code> sets value to the variable so works well in conjunction with <code>let</code>.</li>
<li><code>buffer-substring-no-properties p1 p2</code> returns content with no additional information from buffer between two points <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have mentioned <em>kill-ring</em>. In Emacs you actually don’t delete stuff or erase it. When you kill a line it doesn’t disappear. It exists in a kill ring. By removing one symbol at a time with DEL or BACKSPACE it doesn’t go to kill ring but for example <code>C-x k</code> which kills the whole line forward with respect to the cursor - does. </p>
<h3 id="run_this_thing">run this thing</h3>
<p>Put the cursor after the last parentheses <code>)</code> and hit <code>C-x C-e</code> to evaluate elisp code. Cool thing is - you can evaluate anywhere you want. I write some Lua code and want to quickly divide 8889 by 45? I type <code>(/ 8889 45)</code> hit <code>C-x C-e</code> and see the result at the bottom. Note that to cast result to float at least one operand needs to be a float so 8889 would be 8889.0 or 45 should be 45.0 as integers are promoted to floats when in doubt.</p>
<p>Now as we have a function evaluated and no buffer opened with error message we can see functions name at the bottom our function name meaning Emacs got it. It has our new function. Now again: <code>M-x describe-variable</code> type ‘user-init-file’ then <code>M-&lt; arrow-down</code> and <code>M-x copy-in-quotes</code>and now the strings between quotes is copied into the clipboard. </p>
<p>If I want to have this functionality always as I use Emacs, I need to open <code>.emacs</code> file again. As I haven’t killed it’s buffer previously with <code>C-x k</code> I can simply <code>C-x b ema RET</code> and buffer with <code>ema</code> pattern in its name opens. So <code>.emacs</code> is now opened. <code>M-&gt;</code> go to the end of the file then copy the function definition and key binding definition <code>C-x C-s</code> to save. </p>
<p>As we have edited <code>.emacs</code> file we need to evaluate new code. We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>restart Emacs.</li>
<li><code>M-x load-file .emacs</code> to evaluate elisp file.</li>
<li>evaluate by hand each definition with <code>C-x C-e</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Extra">Extra</h2>
<p>Where to search for information about Emacs? Official website is a mind blowing resource describing every bit of Emacs and Elisp. It’s such a good documentation it deserves some kind of a medal.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html" title="Official guide" target="_blank" rel="external">Official guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs" title="stackoverflow emacs tag" target="_blank" rel="external">Stackoverflow emacs tag</a></li>
<li><a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/" title="emacs.stackexchange" target="_blank" rel="external">emacs.stackexchange</a></li>
<li>IRC freenode #emacs channel</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last - IRC part I need to mention that all of you have heard a joke that Emacs is not just a text editor. So you want some quick help on IRC so you go to download IRC client or. No no no. Stop. <code>M-x rcirc</code> and see as it automatically connects to freenode irc server by default with a random nickname. <code>/join #emacs</code> and ask your question! People there are quick to respond and got me a lot of useful asnwers.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was in doubt if I should begin again my journey through emacs and “waste” my time on it.  I always though that it’s quite useless to invest into such an editor as I though that one spends more time thinking about code than writing it.</p>
<p>The light hit me once a coworker told me that vim made him navigate through the project more smoothly. I changed my perspective that a decent editor lets you dive into a project with more pleasure and maybe more easily. Currently I miss some features of sublime text which I believe can be done with some elisp so later on I will write more in depth guides.</p>
<p>This post is not about teaching about Emacs or anything like that as I just mashed stuff from the tip of my tongue in one evening. With this post I wanted to show that Emacs is not some evil magical thing which is very hard to get started. Also I tried to show that Emacs is a pleasure to extend.</p>

        <p>So I am here at part 3 improving my Emacs understanding each day while experimenting. I’ve gotta say - there’s a lot of useful stuff I have never header before!</p>
<h2 id="The_bad">The bad</h2>
<p>In Sublime Text I was used to two things very very very well and one thing quite a bit. Two being: mini map and tabbed interface, one being file tree explorer. My disappointment is that I have tried to use <em>Tabbar</em> but it really sucked as I immediately used Emacs in split-window mode and each of the windows have it’s own tab header which is maybe great but really unnatural for me. I will forget this for a while until I can mod it on my own or just get used to buffer switching.</p>
<h2 id="The_middle-man">The middle-man</h2>
<p>I have used <em>speedbar</em> which is average on file exploring(no tree structure) but has it’s main disadvantage - it’s a separate window. Come on - who uses that? Even if I work with a single screen I am still not going to resize Emacs to windows mode just to have <em>speedbar</em> opened. Or maybe I shouldn’t? Well.. - <em>sr-speedbar</em> to the rescue! Just <code>M-x package-list</code> install <em>sr-speedbar</em> and it is “Single Frame Speedbar” which is great. Except it’s quite ugly.</p>
<h2 id="The_good">The good</h2>
<p>Oh man! I have mentioned <em>skewer</em> in <a href="http://www.letsdive.in/2014/02/03/emacs_part2/" target="_blank" rel="external">part 2</a> and now I have played with it for a while. I didn’t give it a go in real project but for experiments it’s amazing!. Let me tell you why if you don’t know - it allows direct HTML/CSS/JS modifications in the real time. That sounds great but without an example these are just words! So example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <em>skewer</em> with the usual <code>M-x package-install</code></li>
<li>go into dired mode, hit <code>+</code> create “demo” folder and enter it</li>
<li><code>C-x C-f</code> type in “demo.js” <code>RET RET</code></li>
<li>3rd step with “demo.html”</li>
</ol>
<p>Now as my beginner emacs configuration may really suck I have manually enabled <em>js2-mode</em> and <em>skewer-mode</em>  on my <em>demo.js</em> buffer and <em>skewer-html</em> on <em>demo.html</em> buffer.</p>
<p>Let the magic start! - <code>M-x run-skewer</code>. Bam a new binded browser window appears. That’s cool. But sadly unusable.</p>
<p>Now as I have mentioned I am really sucky on Emacs so just made a node.js http server with connect library(to install - <code>npm install connect</code>):</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1

    <span class="keyword">connect</span>.static(__dirname)
).<span class="keyword">listen</span>(<span class="number">8000</span>);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Now - <code>node server.js</code><br><br>Now skewer runs on 8080 port and our demo app is hosted on 8000 port. All good but now how do I bind my <code>localhost:8000</code> to skewer? I have missed it at first but in readme there this javascript code:<br><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span>{</span><span class="keyword">var</span> d=document;<span class="keyword">var</span> s=d.createElement(<span class="string">'script'</span>);s.src=<span class="string">'http://localhost:8080/skewer'</span>;d.body.appendChild(s);})()
</pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Man that’s advanced…! This script is really sucky because it appears that if I press some key bindings at the wrong file or place it throws an error and that’s all - I need to refresh the window manually and inject the script again. I will look for the error to appear again and will modify skewer js code to handle the situation painlessly.<br><br>As this code is injected that’s all. Our files are binded to our demo.html page. Let’s see what we can do. In <em>demo.html</em> let’s type in:<br><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1

<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Lets just now hit <code>C-M-x</code>. What I have noticed that it must be done at once. Not Control then Alt then x, but Control and Alt and then x. This loads the html code to browser.</p>
<p>Now inside <em>demo.js</em> lets do some simple stuff:</p>
<p><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> left = <span class="number">0</span>;
document.getElementById(<span class="string">'click'</span>).onclick = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
  left += <span class="number">2</span>;
  document.getElementById(<span class="string">'box'</span>).style.left = left + <span class="string">'px'</span>;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Now again - <code>C-M-x</code> to load the code in the browser. Now if I click the button a few times I can see that it moves by 2 pixels to the right after each click. The magic begins when I go to the <em>demo.js</em> and change <code>left += 2;</code> into <code>left += 20;</code> and hit <code>C-M-x</code>. Now lets click and what do we see? We can see the box moving to the right by 20 pixels but the page was not refreshed! The page kept it’s state, variables and other things in place!</p>
<h2 id="Extra">Extra</h2>
<p>As I have mentioned in part 2 - <code>C-x C-e</code> evaluates elisp normally and javascript in <em>js2-mode</em> so if I move my cursor to the end of <code>left += 2;</code> then hit <code>C-x C-e</code> and can see current value in the mini buffer. Yay! The same can be done for DOM elements where <code>document.getElementById()</code> appears!</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was really excited about skewer and really wanted to have it working. I simply don’t know why or if it’s useful but during my javascript development I really got tired of having my page state reseted after each change. Sometimes it’s just too slow for me to write some kind of automation because it’s just quicker and more efficient to hit F5 and manually fill in the details or adjust components to their desired state… Now with skewer in my hands I may do pretty things.</p>

        <h2 id="Skewer">Skewer</h2>
<p>The second part went really quick(another day as you can see). I have found <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/skewer-mode" target="_blank" rel="external">skewer-mode</a> for emacs. I have found another - swank-js but skewer is made to be EASY to setup and so I tried. And so I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Today is my second day using Emacs and I have full comfort in it. That just shows how little of functionality I have actually used from my editors in the past. Or maybe that Emacs is that good. So what’s the skewer? It’s Javascript evaluator in the browser as I can say in my own words. Why is it cool? Well… BECAUSE I CAN EDIT MY JAVASCRIPT DIRECTLY AND CHANGES APPEAR AS IMMEDIATELY AS I WANT.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>C-x C-f</code> type in “demo.js” <code>RET</code><br>2) in the new file I do <code>M-x run-skewer</code><br>3) Then <code>M-x skewer-mode</code><br>4) Now I type this code:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

10
11
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> obj = {
	name: <span class="string">"test object"</span>,
	run: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
	  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">'I am running...'</span>;
	}
}

<span class="keyword">var</span> a = <span class="number">3</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> x = <span class="built_in">Math</span>.random();
x;
obj.run();
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now to evaluate it’s the same as for elisp - <code>C-x C-e</code>. Now if I put my cursor on the <code>x;</code> at the end of it then <code>C-x C-e</code> and I see in the mini buffer - a random number - a result from <code>Math.random()</code>!. Now let’s have some fun and put the cursor at the end of <code>obj.run();</code> hit <code>C-x C-e</code> and what? An error? Ah yes! <code>C-c C-k</code> to load the whole source into the buffer then again retry this and it sure outputs “I am running…” in the mini buffer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately to log something out <code>console.log()</code> doesn’t work. There’s a special <code>skewer.log()</code> for this but I really don’t enjoy it. Now on the other side - there’s no reason an application should hold <code>console.log()</code> statements so I can live with that too. Note that once you ran <code>M-x run-skewer</code> it opened a new windows in a default browser and binded emacs to it. So for example if I type in <code>alert(&#39;EMACS&#39;);</code> put cursor at the end and hit <code>C-x C-e</code> it sure fires an alert in a binded window on a browser.</p>
<h2 id="Extra">Extra</h2>
<p>There’s a REPL which can be opened with <code>M-x skewer-repl</code>. I don’t know how much this is useful as I am used to pressing <code>C-shift-j</code> or F12 and manually selecting <em>Console</em> to do my REPL stuff.</p>

        <p>I have always had interest in some old bizarre editor like <em>vim</em> or <em>emacs</em>. A few years ago I started to notice that I really enjoy using keyboard instead of a mouse and so I tried to learn all most often used key combination in all the software I use daily.</p>
<p>I though that I am a typing machine because I use so much of my keyboard. Wrong. I compiled a list of my often used combinations and it is… small. Look:</p>

<p>For example: now I press and hold PgUp key then hit Home key to get back to the start of a line then shift-down(5 times) and I have just successfully selected first 5 lines. Then I can copy them (C-c) and paste anywhere I want or to move them with C-shift-arrows.</p>
<p>As a great exercise I have turned this blog entry into my emacs exercise - I am writing this post from within emacs in markdown. On the very basic level I have really liked emacs after maybe two hours of experimenting and I have almost have all my key bindings in emacs. I did not redefine emacs commands so they would match the ones in the table. I am trying to use emacs as it is.</p>
<p>In emacs there are only two control keys - C(trl) and M(alt) by default. It really clicks me as I am used that these keys provide additional functionality for my keys. The commands are written in a form like <code>C-x C-f</code> which means <code>press and hold Ctrl then x, release both, press and hold Ctrl then f, release</code>. So here’s the article with translations of my combinations to emacs combinations.</p>
<p>I have not put them in table as emacs has a bit different interface. For example in emacs way to select some text I go to the starting position and click <code>C-space</code> then I go around with arrow keys and once I want to copy what I have selected I do <code>M-w</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Copy_+_Paste">Copy + Paste</h2>
<p>To paste the text it’s <code>C-y</code>. Copying and pasting was the fastest thing in emacs I got right from the start. I move my arrows then <code>C-space</code> then <code>M-w</code> then somewhere else it’s <code>C-y</code>. If I want to cut the text - it’s <code>C-w</code> instead of <code>M-w</code>. See the similarity? The same key but different control key and it’s <em>copy</em> or <em>cut</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Undo_+_Redo">Undo + Redo</h2>
<p>To undo/redo I use <code>C-/</code>. This works like a normal undo however if I would like to redo I just click <code>C-f</code> and then each <code>C-/</code> is a redo. <code>C-f</code> again and it’s undo again. I believe this will be a little sucker for a while as I don’t have any clue about current state. While writing this post I have done it a few times and it really feels natural for me except the <code>C-f</code> part where I am not sure if I am undoing or redoing.</p>
<h2 id="Search">Search</h2>
<p>To search within a current file I use <code>C-s</code>. This is not as I am used too because this only searched in down-direction only and doesn’t accept a regex. Of course I don’t believe emacs does not have an easy way to fix this and doing <code>C-h k</code> meaning <em>describe a keybinding for me</em> gives me that pressing <code>M-r</code> gives me regular expression search. Yes it works good. It sucks a bit that some of keys like DEL have special meaning so it’s not so easy to modify search so I just press <code>C-g</code> to cancel current command then hit <code>C-s</code> again and type in from the scratch. I don’t want to burden myself with ALL the details about each command, I just want a way to do my daily combinations even if not so well but I really think this will be over in a few moments. On the other note - <code>C-r</code> turns on search backwards so I can live with that temporarily until I will learn enough Emacs LISP to modify them.</p>
<h2 id="Search_+_Replace">Search + Replace</h2>
<p>Search without a replace is only 50% of functionality I need. Search and replace can be done with <code>M-%</code> which is <code>M-shift-5</code> on my keyboard. I simply enter string to replace hit <code>RET</code> then enter string to replace with. No this will not immediately change everything but will go through each occurrence of entered string. <code>n</code> skips the replace for selected result and <code>y</code> or <code>space</code> replaces the occurrence. Of course sometimes I like simply ALL the occurrences changed then instead of <code>y</code> or <code>space</code> one should hit <code>!</code> to replace all the occurrences.</p>
<h2 id="Selections">Selections</h2>
<p>Select all. I though that this will be available as some easy command but I managed to get around this by a quick combination of keys. Lets rinse and repeat:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>C-home</code> - goes to the very top and puts cursor at the first character on the first line of my current buffer.</li>
<li><code>C-space</code> - turns on selection mode.</li>
<li><code>C-end</code> - goes to the very bottom to the last character so all the content is selected.</li>
<li><code>M-w</code>   - copy all I have selected(all the content).<br><em>NEAT!</em><br>What’s more neat that there’s a default keybinding for this - <code>C-x h</code>. I really though that I will have to remap these myself and I am happy that I will not have to do so.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Files">Files</h2>
<p>Saving files is simple. I noticed that a lot of IO commands start with <code>C-x</code>. For example if I want to open some file I do <code>C-x C-f</code> then type in the whole filename or just part of it and hit <code>tab</code> then I see possible files for my query. I can also navigate in the query through the folders. If I type in not existing file I simply just got it created. This doesn’t feel all natural as if I close the file with <code>C-x C-k</code>(kill buffer) it doesn’t get saved. <code>C-x C-s</code> does that as it forces to write the contents into the file I just created. If I am lazy enough to open search file query and create a new file from there I can hit <code>C-x C-w</code> and enter a filename in the query to have current buffer saved as that file. So now for example if I create a HTML file and would like to save it and work on it later(saving each modification) I do these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>C-x C-f</code></li>
<li>enter <code>test.html</code></li>
<li>type in <html></html></li>
<li><code>C-x C-s</code><br>Done. Now we have test.html file with <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> as contents and it’s currently opened in our emacs buffer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Cursors">Cursors</h2>
<p>Multiple cursors for the win! Multiple cursors are simply an effect of <em>rectangles</em>. Rectangle commands can be reached with <code>C-x r</code> then often another letter is an operation. For example <code>t</code> - insert text, <code>d</code> - delete. Now rectangles can be quite tricky as from my short experience with emacs. For example if I have this text:</p>
<p>  hello/world/file1.txt<br>  hello/world/file2.txt<br>  hello/world/file3.txt<br>  hello/world/file4.txt<br>  hello/world/file5.txt</p>
<p>and I would like to delete <em>hello/world/</em> part or replace with <em>another/path/</em>. Lets do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the first hello, put cursor on <em>h</em> letter</li>
<li><code>C-space</code> or simply hit shift</li>
<li>with arrows go to world on the last line, put cursor on <em>/</em> character</li>
<li><code>C-x r d</code> to delete all the <em>hello/world/</em> or <code>C-x r t</code> then type in <em>another/path/</em> and hit enter</li>
</ol>
<p>Vuola! This is not like multiple cursors where I was used to Sublimes <code>C-d</code> to set the cursor on another occurrence on currently selected word or search result however for a while I can live with rectangles or search and replace.</p>
<h2 id="Buffers">Buffers</h2>
<p>Shifting through the buffers or files. Multiple windows. Now as I have opened a few files I have one big screen with this blog entry in it. I can switch through the buffers with <code>C-x arrow</code> where arrow is left/right arrow. So yeah <code>C-x right right right left left left</code> returns me back to where I am. Of course this is handy only when I have maybe 2 or 3 files opened and I want to switch between them quickly… But what if I have multiple buffers opened and just want to navigate through them? <code>C-x b</code> to the rescue! As I have ido mode enabled once I press <code>C-x b</code> I get a nice list of buffers and I can simply type part of the name of it and hit <code>RET</code> and here I am. So now I see that I have buffers: “Shell Command Output”, “Help”, “Info”, “emacs_part1.md”, … I hit <code>C-x b</code> type in <code>shel</code> hit <code>RET</code> and I am in “Shell Command Output” buffer. While being there I hit <code>C-x b</code> type in “em pa” hit <code>RET</code> and I am inside this blog again.</p>
<p>Now what about windows? Hit <code>C-x 2</code> and two windows appear with the same blog in it splitted horizontally. If I hit <code>C-x 3</code> two windows appear side by side. Now I am currently in my first buffer and I want to display “Shell Command Output” in another. I hit <code>C-x o</code> to switch buffers and my cursor appears in the second window. <code>C-x b</code> type in “she” hit <code>RET</code> and the second window is filled with “Shell Command Output” contents in it. Now I can switch back to my blog with <code>C-x o</code> again. This is really nice! While I am on my blog, I would like to make it again single fullscreen so I hit <code>C-x 1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Extra!">Extra!</h2>
<p>Some extra before finishing first part! We can use ELISP anywhere in the emacs. What do I mean? If I type in here (* 1 2 3), then select it with shift and arrow then hit <code>C-x C-e</code> it evaluates the expression and shows the result in the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Moving selected lines of text around as I do easily in sublime is not that basic from my research so I leave it for another part.</p>
<p>What I suggest - first watch the parts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRYzPWnk2mE" target="_blank" rel="external">YouTube</a> and then you can use this post as a reference. The video series go through the basics. Customization of emacs and common problems. All the parts weight maybe 40minutes in total so it’s really a no brainer not to watch them.</p>
